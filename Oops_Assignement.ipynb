        "# Class: A blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines the structure and behavior that objects of the class will have, including properties (attributes) and methods (functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "# Object: An instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with attributes and behaviors. Objects interact with one another through methods and properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Encapsulation: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is done through access modifiers like private, public, or protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Inheritance: The mechanism by which one class (the child or subclass) inherits the attributes and behaviors (methods) from another class (the parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and creates a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Polymorphism: The ability of objects of different types to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. This can be achieved via method overriding (same method, different implementations in subclasses) or method overloading (same method name but different parameters)."
